# odin_landing-page

This project is a "simple" 1 page website. The point of the project is to practice my current html and css skills.

I decided I wanted to challenge myself and go with the conventional way of writing out html, something I haven't learned about yet in TOP.

(So to call this a simple one-pager is an understatement, I struggled a bit with this project.)

But I'm glad I did - I've gotten better from getting out of my comfort zone and I've finally got my first website under my belt. 

As for the skills I got to practice:

-Writing cleaner code
-Making website layouts
-Importing external fonts
-Keeping my code organized
-Staying consistent with (my own) css naming convention
-Getting more comfortable with flexbox and css as a whole

I'm proud with the outcome and although the site isn't responsive, making a layout is the first step to getting there!

I can now confidently say that I can make more complex website layouts.
